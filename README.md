# Projects for CodSoft Internship

This repository contains three projects developed as part of my internship at CodSoft. Each project demonstrates core programming concepts, user interface design, and problem-solving skills. Below are the details of the projects:

## 1. **Simple Calculator**
A lightweight and user-friendly calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations.

### **Features**
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clean and intuitive user interface.
- Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero).

### **Technologies Used**
- Programming Language: c++

### **How to Use**
1. Launch the application.
2. Enter two numbers and select an operation.
3. The result is displayed instantly.

## 2. **To-Do List**
A simple and effective to-do list application to manage tasks and boost productivity.

### **Features**
- Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Tasks are saved for future reference (if persistent storage is implemented).

### **Technologies Used**
- Programming Language: c++

### **How to Use**
1. Open the application.
2. Add tasks by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
3. Manage tasks using the provided options (edit, delete, or mark as complete).

## 3. **Tic Tac Toe**
A classic two-player game built with a simple yet engaging user interface.

### **Features**
- Two-player mode.

- Reset option to start a new game.

### **Technologies Used**
- Programming Language: c++

### **How to Play**
1. Launch the game.
2. Players take turns selecting cells on the grid.
3. The first player to align three symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
